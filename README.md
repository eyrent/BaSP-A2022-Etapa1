# Trackgenix

### About this project
As an assignment for the **Become a Software Developer**  bootcamp (2022 edition) by [Radium Rocket](https://radiumrocket.com/) I, as past of a work team, set out to develop a website/web app called **Trackgenix**. This file covers that development process.

## Project Log

### Week 0
- **Trackgenix**'s landing page and screen were laid out in Figma to create [demo prototypes](https://www.figma.com/proto/2t7XPyK3dineUQt2Coyxj6/UI-kit-RR-BaSP-A?node-id=653%3A1345) that could showcase the site's functionality.

- My team focused mainly on the _Employee_ and _Project Manager_ type screens. **The design and layout will be subjected to alterations and upgrade as required** by the client through feedback.

### Week 1

- This sprint's objective is to create the initial html document for **Trackgenix**'s landing page as well as setting up this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eyrent/BaSP-A2022-Etapa1) to track changes.

- The pieces of **text for the landing page were updated** to better reflect the look and functionality of the landing page. These were generated by a GPT-3 AI by [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/playground) which took commissioning information as prompt and generated short descriptions and elaborations to replace 'lorem ipsum' placeholder. Also **some words were given suitable semantic tags to improve SEO**.

- Icons were extracted from the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/2t7XPyK3dineUQt2Coyxj6/UI-kit-RR-BaSP-A) used during the design and prototyping stage and included in the page. I selected two other pictures for the same use as well. However **these icons are in the darker colour version** in order to be seen when rendered by the browser without styles. They **will be updated to their light variants** when there's an appropiate background.

## Known issues

- At the moment, in Figma, there's no convenient way of showing a drop-down menu with choosable options. The dropdown menu of tasks will behave like a regular one.
- At the moment, in Figma, there's no way to alter the content of text boxes to reflect a selected/clicked option in a dropdown menu. The date selector component, specifically won't change the placeholder text in the date range fields (in _Reports_).
