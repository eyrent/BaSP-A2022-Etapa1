# Trackgenix

### About this project
As an assignment for the **Become a Software Developer**  bootcamp (2022 edition) by [Radium Rocket](https://radiumrocket.com/) I, as past of a work team, set out to develop a website/web app called **Trackgenix**. This file covers that development process.

## Project Log
### Week 0
**Trackgenix**'s landing page and screen were laid out in Figma to create demo prototypes that could showcase the site's functionality. 

My team focused mainly on the Employee and Project Manager type screens. The design and layout will be subjected to alterations and upgrade as required by the client through feedback.
### Week 1
This sprint's objective is to create the initial html document for **Trackgenix**'s landing page as well as setting up this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eyrent/BaSP-A2022-Etapa1) to track changes.
